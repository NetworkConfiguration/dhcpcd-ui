.Sh NAME
.Nm dhcpcd-qt
.Nd a Qt frontend for network configuration
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a Qt frontend for network configuration.
It uses
.Xr dhcpcd 8
and
.Xr wpa_supplicant 8
as backends.
.Xr dhcpcd 8
needs to be running in Master mode for
.Nm
to work with it.
.Pp
If
.Nm
is used to make configuration changes then the user needs to be able
to write to the privileged
.Nm dhcpcd
control socket as well as
.Pa /etc/dhcpcd.conf .
See
.Xr dhcpcd.conf 5
for details.
.Ss wpa_supplicant
.Nm
relies on
.Xr wpa_supplicant 8
being configured to write its sockets to
.Pa /var/run/wpa_supplicant.
If 
.Nm
is used to select and set pass phrases for wireless networks then
update_config=1
needs to be set in wpa_supplicant.conf.
.Sh NOTES
If
.Nm
is linked agaist Qt-5 then debug output is disabled by default.
To enable debug to the console add this to
.Pa ~/.config/QtProject/qtlogging.ini
.Pp
.D1 [Rules]
