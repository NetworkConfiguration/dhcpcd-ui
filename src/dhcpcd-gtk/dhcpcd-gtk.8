.Sh NAME
.Nm dhcpcd-gtk
.Nd a GTK+ frontend for network configuration
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a GTK+ frontend for network configuration.
It uses
.Xr dhcpcd 8
and
.Xr wpa_supplicant 8
as backends.
.Pp
If
.Nm
is used to make configuration changes then the user needs to be able
to write to the privileged
.Nm dhcpcd
control socket.
See
.Xr dhcpcd.conf 5
for details.
.Ss wpa_supplicant
.Nm
relies on
.Xr wpa_supplicant 8
being configured to write its sockets to
.Pa /var/run/wpa_supplicant.
If 
.Nm
is used to select and set pass phrases for wireless networks then
update_config=1
needs to be set in wpa_supplicant.conf.
