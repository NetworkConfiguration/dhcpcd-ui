dhcpcd-gtk
----------
SSID menus need updating when we get new scans like dhcpcd-qt handles it.

dhcpcd-qt
---------
Needs knotifyplugin support.
Consider compiling with both this and the QSystemTray bubble and falling
back to it if knotifyplugin fails to work, like say changing from KDE
desktop to LXQT.

dhcpcd-efl
----------
Port it!

TODO's for all
-----------------------------------
  *  Merge multiple BSSID's with the same SSID into one menu item rather
     than many, picking the strongest one.
  *  OpenVPN config screen per user and system wide, triggerd via dhcpcd hook.

NON STARTING IDEAS
------------------
  *  Complex IP setups, this is only a tool for $MOM.
