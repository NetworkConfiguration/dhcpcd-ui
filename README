dhcpcd-ui is the graphical interface to dhcpcd-5.x

It has a helper library in C to try and minimize any toolkit
specific parts.

There are GTK+-2 (works with GTK+-3) and Qt-4 front ends.
an EFL (e17) front end is planned.

A basic command line tool, dhcpcd-online can report on network
availability from dhcpcd (requires dhcpcd-6.4.4)

Switches to control building of various parts:
	--with-dhcpcd-online
	--with-gtk
	--with-qt
	--with-icons
For each --with there is a --without.
If each part is not specified then the configure will test the system
for the needed libraries to build and install it.

When creating a distribution tarball, the host system requires
the libraries to build all the components.
