dhcpcd-ui is the graphical interface to dhcpcd

It has a helper library in C so you don't *have* to learn each toolkit
DBus implementation, or depend on it (dbus-glib, edbus, qt-dbus, etc).

Currently only a GTK+ front end is available, but there are plans to
create an EWL (Enlightment E17) front end.
I don't use KDE/QT much, but it should be quite easy.

dhcpcd-ui depends on hicolor-icon-theme from freedesktop.org
