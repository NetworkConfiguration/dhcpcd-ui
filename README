dhcpcd-ui is the graphical interface to dhcpcd-5.x

It has a helper library in C to try and minimize any toolkit
specific parts.

There are GTK+-2 (works with GTK+-3) and Qt-4 front ends.
an EFL (e17) front end is planned.

A basic command line tool, dhcpcd-online can report on network
availability from dhcpcd (requires dhcpcd-6.4.4)
